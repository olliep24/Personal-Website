                            This school project was an open ended design challenge that had to follow strict functionality, efficiency,
                            and security restrictions. I developed a file sharing system that allowed users to log in from multiple devices, edit files,
                            and share those files while keeping them completely secure againts adversaries using cryptographic procedures. The design of this project
                            was particularly challenging, but seeing the final product and its performance was very rewarding.

                            Exploiting Memory Safety Vulnerabilities (EMSV) was my first project for CS 161 - Computer Security.
                            I was tasked to examine vulneralbe C code and exploit it to run shellcode based on a x86 architecture.
                            The vulnerabilities included buffer overflows, format string, integer memory safety, and off-by-one
                            vulnerabilities. Mitigations like stack canaries, non-executable pages, and ASLR were sometimes active,
                            so I had to engineer attacks to get around them.

                            CS61CPU was one of the largest school projects I've done. I emulated a RISC-V processor in

                            enjoyed this project, and understanding the hardware of a computer has given me more engineering insights than

                            when taking the extra steps to plan more effectively and follow convention, the code effectively wrote itself.

                            Growing up playing tennis, I was thrilled to begin my first internship at SwingVision. It was
                            a great experience working for a ML company. My main responsibility was labeling videos to acquire data 
                            for the machine learning algorithms using CVAT. Working at the data collection level gave me insight
                            into how data is collected, how it can be miscollected, and what biases can lie within in it. I believe
                            this was quite eye-opening because knowing that these situations are possible in data collection aids in
                            data analysis and understanding.

                            Build Your Own World (BYOW) was my final project for my data structures class (CS 61B). Unlike other school
                            projects, the given project spec and skeleton code was minimal, allowing complete freedom for design. The goal 
                            of this project was to generate interactable, pseudorandom game worlds given an input seed. This project was
                            challenging given the lack of guidance, but that allowed me to spark my curiousity and design abilities to 
                            construct a platfort that minimized code complexity. I believe I refined my skills as a

                            WordNet was a really cool project to work on. It revolved around semantic relationships and word 
                            usage overtime in the English language. First, I developed a data structure to hold word usage over time, which
                            transferred data to a frontend replicating <a href="https://books.google.com/ngrams/">Google's Ngram Viewer.</a> 
                            The next part of the project revolved around semantic relationships, which can visualized with a directed acyclic 
                            graph as seen in the image. The code used a graph data structure to supply a user with any information regarding 
                            semanitc relationships in the English language. Both parts parsed text files to retrieve the data to supply the user.

                            Pitch Black was the result of GDD's 1 week long game jam. I coded alongside another programmer and an artist to create
                            2D maze game. The scene is set in an abandoned mansion where a young teenager lost his baseball inside. You play
                            as the unfortunate teenager looking for the missing ball. All you have is a baseball bat to defend yourself from
                            the ghost that haunts the mansion.

                            In Deques, I implemented two versions of the double ended queue data structure with linked lists and arrays.
                            Both had circular topology, which I thought made that code very enjoyable. Altogether, this project was a great

                            2048 was my first java project in CS 61B. It was a quick project that reintroduced me to the java syntax while
                            focussing on ideas of abstraction though multiple helper methods. In the end, I programmed the logic for
                            game.

                            Hog was my very first coding project. It focused on conditionals, iteration, and higher order functions. The premise
                            was a complex dice game with fun rules played between two players. This was definitely a beginner level project, 
                            but it was a great instructional experience.
