                            of coding difficult algorithms, the algorithms involved are simple yet the vastness of the project makes it
                            difficult to organize. I find figuring out how to manage complexity for the ease of programming really intriguing.

                            when taking the extra steps to plan more effectively and follow convention, the code effectively wrote itself.

                            Build Your Own World (BYOW) was my final project for my data structures class (CS 61B). Unlike other school
                            projects, the given project spec and skeleton code was minimal, allowing complete freedom for design. The goal 
                            of this project was to generate interactable, pseudorandom game worlds given an input seed. This project was
                            challenging given the lack of guidance, but that allowed me to spark my curiousity and design abilities to 
                            construct a platfort that minimized code complexity. I believe I refined my skills as a 
                            programmer the most with this project.

                            WordNet was a really cool project to work on. It revolved around semantic relationships and word 
                            usage overtime in the English language. First, I developed a data structure to hold word usage over time, which
                            transferred data to a frontend replicating <a href="https://books.google.com/ngrams/">Google's Ngram Viewer.</a> 
                            The next part of the project revolved around semantic relationships, which can visualized with a directed acyclic 
                            graph as seen in the image. The code used a graph data structure to supply a user with any information regarding 
                            semanitc relationships in the English language. Both parts parsed text files to retrieve the data to supply the user.

                            In Deques, I implemented two versions of the double ended queue data structure with linked lists and arrays.
                            Both had circular topology, which I thought made that code very enjoyable. Altogether, this project was a great

                            I first got interested with CSM when I took one of their tutoring sessions for CS61A. I then ignited a passion
                            for teaching. I joined CSM as a junior mentor the next semester, teaching the class I just took. I'm now a senior
                            mentor for another class, which involves guiding junior mentors for their tutroing sessions.

                            Scheme was a project that I feel I learned a lot from. I coded a scheme interpreter in python. It really
                            cemented my understanding of how computer programs are interpreted and evaluated.

                            Ants was my first object oriented porgramming project and was one of my favorites. It was a 2D tower defense game that
                            drew inspiration from <a href="https://www.ea.com/ea-studios/popcap/plants-vs-zombies">Plants vs. Zombies</a>
                            where specialized ants would attack incoming bees.

                            Hog was my very first coding project. It focused on conditionals, iteration, and higher order functions. The premise
                            was a complex dice game with fun rules played between two players. This was definitely a beginner level project, 
                            but it was a great instructional experience.
